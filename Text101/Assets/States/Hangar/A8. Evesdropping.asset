  _storyText: 'You slink through the machinery towards 2 skanky looking men. The
    tall, scrawny one is carrying an oversized gas-canister-powered arrow shooter,
    while the shorter dumpy man has strapped to him at least a dozen small glass
    bottles with grey liquid inside.

    

    The stout fellow finishes cranking
    a large valve (clockwise you notice) and then both men dash off with much haste.

    

    What
    to do?

    

    1. Quick, uncrank that valve, they were clearly up to no
    good.

    2. Chase the men.'
